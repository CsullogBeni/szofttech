\section{Prioritized user stories}

Prioritizing with the help of MoSCoW method.
\begin{itemize}
    \item M - Must have
    \item S - Should have
    \item C - Could have
    \item W - Won't have
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Must have user stories:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Select executable:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Filters all executables from the working direcoty.
        \item Collects all details of these, such as description, name, and arguments. It also collects all information about the arguments.
        \item Full path to the program, that will be needed during execution.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Execute program:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Executing the programs with using its full path and the appropriate compiler or interpreter.
        \item If information available of the values of the arguments, These must be used during execution.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Add argument
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This user story ensures that the user can provide a value for an argument as input.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Should have user stories}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Toggle flag
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the argument is a flag, user can switch whether it should store a true or false.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Select choices
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If there are choices within the argument, the user should select one of them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Save config
     \begin{itemize}
         \item Users are able to store their configurations.
     \end{itemize}
     \item Load config
     \begin{itemize}
         \item Users are able to load their previously saved configurations.
     \end{itemize}
     \item Clear history
     \begin{itemize}
         \item Users are able to delete their configurations.
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Could have user stories}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Search an executable
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users are able to search for specified scripts.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Clear search
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After searching users can delete their search history.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Won't have user stories }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pin an executable
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users are able to pin programs as favourite, and those will be highlighted.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Unpin an executable
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users are able to unpin a pinned program.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{KPI: Increase Monthly Active Users (MAU)}

\subsection{KPI Definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description}: The KPI is defined as the number of unique users who actively use the product at least once per month.
    \item \textbf{Correlation}: There is a strong correlation between an increase in Monthly Active Users (MAU) and user engagement growth. Increasing the active user base enhances the app's attractiveness to potential advertisers, sponsors, or future paid feature introductions.
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Precision}: The KPI is measured as the total count of distinct users who have logged in or performed a specific action within the past 30 days.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{KPI Goal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target}: Achieve a 40\% increase in Monthly Active Users by the end of the fourth quarter of a calendar or fiscal year (in one year) to significantly enhance the app's appeal and community impact.
    \item \textbf{Significance}: A 40\% growth represents a substantial challenge, requiring creative marketing strategies and feature expansions, which will significantly improve the app's visibility and user community.
    \item \textbf{Time-bound}: The goal is to achieve this increase by the end of the fourth quarter of a calendar or fiscal year (in one year), making it an ambitious but attainable target.
\end{itemize}
