In the proving area, users can use the hypothesis axiom and various detaching rules. It is also possible to add an axiom, provided the given formula is an axiom. The help section shows further details about rule usage. The hint button attempts to execute a detaching rule if feasible. Users can also save the current derivation.

On the loading screen, users can load a previous derivation of a conclusion. The buttons display the saving date, time, and the conclusion. Saves can be deleted.
